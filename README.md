# Move Indexer

- **Team Name:**  TrackIt-Block

### Overview

In the realm of Web3 indexing, the Move Indexer is an innovative Rest/GraphQL service meticulously designed to simplify interactions with assets on Move-based blockchain protocols. This service has been purpose-built to function as a robust data layer for various assets, including smart contracts, within decentralized applications (dApps). It leverages the user-friendly features of GraphQL and REST API to streamline this process.

Presently, developers encounter significant hurdles when dealing with assets interactions on Move based blockchains due to the intricacies and time-consuming nature of querying. The Move Indexer steps in to alleviate these challenges by offering an intuitive GraphQL interface(as well as CLI), thereby significantly reducing the time and effort required to access and query these assets.

The Move Indexer offers several key advantages, including its primary focus on ease of use, remarkable versatility catering to a wide range of use cases, and a strong commitment to bridging the gap between developers and blockchain utilization and documentation. It achieves this while adhering to the principles of decentralization and open-source development, which underscores its dedication to safeguarding user privacy by abstaining from data collection.

By effectively reducing the time and complexity associated with querying assets and presenting a more user-friendly interface, the Move Indexer aspires to promote the growth and evolution of the Web 3.0 ecosystem within the realm of Move-based blockchain technology.

#### Architecture üèó

1. **Architecture Overview:**
   The architecture of this Web3 data indexer is designed with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, ensuring a seamless interaction with various data sources within the Web3 ecosystem.

2. **Language and Reliability:**
   At the core of this architecture is Rust.

3. **Data Processing Framework:**
    Need some suggestions for any favorable framework available

4. **Database System:**
   This architecture interacts with a database(possibility of postgres or any other alternative) or RPC node.

5. **Data Flow:**
   The architectural flow involves several layers:
   - Data is obtained from RPC nodes for real-time data.
   - When new data events are obtained, they are automatically processed by defined handlers. Data is then stored in the database, providing a structured and scalable storage solution.

6. **Data Access and Querying:**
   To expose the data to clients, a GraphQL interface is provided. GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with existing data. It allows clients to request precisely the data they need, optimizing performance and enhancing developer tools.

This architecture is designed to create an efficient and user-friendly framework for managing and querying data within the Web3 ecosystem, ensuring robustness, reliability, and scalability.

#### Technology Stack üíª

- Rust
- Node.js
- Docker
- Postgres(or any DB)
- GraphQL
