# Move Indexer

- **Team Name:**  TrackIt-Block

### Overview

In the realm of Web3 indexing, the Move Indexer is an innovative Rest/GraphQL service meticulously designed to simplify interactions with assets on Move-based blockchain protocols. This service has been purpose-built to function as a robust data layer for various assets, including smart contracts, within decentralized applications (dApps). It leverages the user-friendly features of GraphQL and REST API to streamline this process.

Presently, developers encounter significant hurdles when dealing with assets interactions on Move based blockchains due to the intricacies and time-consuming nature of querying. The Move Indexer steps in to alleviate these challenges by offering an intuitive GraphQL interface(as well as CLI), thereby significantly reducing the time and effort required to access and query these assets.

The Move Indexer offers several key advantages, including its primary focus on ease of use, remarkable versatility catering to a wide range of use cases, and a strong commitment to bridging the gap between developers and blockchain utilization and documentation. It achieves this while adhering to the principles of decentralization and open-source development, which underscores its dedication to safeguarding user privacy by abstaining from data collection.

By effectively reducing the time and complexity associated with querying assets and presenting a more user-friendly interface, the Move Indexer aspires to promote the growth and evolution of the Web 3.0 ecosystem within the realm of Move-based blockchain technology.

#### Architecture üèó
<img src="https://github.com/trackit-block/indexer/blob/main/architecture_diagram.jpeg" width="600" height="600">

1. **Architecture Overview:**
   The architecture of this Web3 data indexer is designed with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, ensuring a seamless interaction with various data sources within the Web3 ecosystem.

2. **Language and Reliability:**
   At the core of this architecture is Rust.

3. **Data Processing Framework:**
    Need some suggestions for any favorable framework available

4. **Database System:**
   This architecture interacts with a database(possibility of postgres or any other alternative) or RPC node.

5. **Data Flow:**
   The architectural flow involves several layers:
   - Data is obtained from RPC nodes for real-time data.
   - When new data events are obtained, they are automatically processed by defined handlers. Data is then stored in the database, providing a structured and scalable storage solution.

6. **Data Access and Querying:**
   To expose the data to clients, a GraphQL interface is provided. GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with existing data. It allows clients to request precisely the data they need, optimizing performance and enhancing developer tools.

This architecture is designed to create an efficient and user-friendly framework for managing and querying data within the Web3 ecosystem, ensuring robustness, reliability, and scalability.

#### Technology Stack üíª

- Rust
- Node.js
- Docker
- Postgres(or any DB)
- GraphQL
  
### Ecosystem Fit

The Web3 data architecture described here is a significant asset to the broader Web3 and data ecosystem. It addresses a variety of challenges that developers frequently encounter when working with blockchain data and data sources, making it an indispensable resource for various projects and applications within the ecosystem.

**Key Aspects of Ecosystem Fit:**

**Tooling** refers to the various software tools and applications that are used by individuals or teams to develop, manage, and maintain software, systems, and infrastructure. These tools are designed to streamline processes, enhance productivity, and support specific tasks within the software development and IT operations domains. Types of tooling include:

- **Development Tools**: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), code editors, version control systems (e.g., Git), compilers, and debugging tools are used by developers to write, test, and manage code.
- **Monitoring and Observability Tools**: Tools like application performance monitoring (APM), log management, and error tracking systems help organizations monitor the health and performance of their applications and infrastructure.
- **Collaboration and Communication Tools**: Messaging platforms, project management software, and team collaboration tools facilitate communication and coordination among team members.
- **Data and Analytics Tools**: Database management systems (DBMS), data analysis platforms, and reporting tools support data storage, analysis, and reporting.
